Streaming Service Churn Prediction

Overview

The goal of this project was to create a binary classification model to predict
users churn during trial time (first 30 days subscription). The project utilized 
data about users behaviour on the streaming platform. The final XGBoost model
performed with 83% accuracy and 76% recall determining what features were most
important in predicting whether a user would churn or not. Based on the model, 
the number of songs skipped before it achieves 50% length, the plan type, 
whether or not the renew plan was set to be automatic and last day of trial time
were the most influencial features. 

Business Understanding

Despite offering a trial experience, the streaming company is experiencing a 
high churn rate during the 30-day trial period. Many trial users decide to cancel
their subscription before the trial ends and do not convert into paying
subscribers. This high churn rate is impacting the company's growth and revenue
potential, making it crucial to identify the reasons behind this early 
cancellation and find effective solutions to retain trial users as loyal 
customers.

Conclusion

The model can benefit the streaming company in knowing if specific user is more
propicious to churn and act before it occurs. The company can also identify 
what's making then be an early churn and draw strategies to improve the user
experience not only during trial time but in general.
